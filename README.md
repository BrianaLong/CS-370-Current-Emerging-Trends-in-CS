Treasure Hunt AI

Project Summary

In this project, I developed an intelligent agent to solve a pirate-themed environment using reinforcement learning. The starter Jupyter Notebook included the game environment setup, helper functions for rewards and actions, and a basic training loop structure. I created the core learning logic myself, including the implementation of a Q-learning algorithm that allowed the pirate agent to learn how to navigate the map, collect treasures, and avoid traps. I modified the hyperparameters, adjusted the reward system, and added code to visualize the agent’s performance over time. By the end of training, the agent demonstrated consistent improvement in decision-making and efficiency.


Connection to Computer Science

Computer scientists use analytical thinking, programming, and experimentation to design intelligent systems that solve complex problems. Reinforcement learning, as applied in this project, is a core example of how computer science drives innovation in automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence. By combining algorithms with real-world data, computer scientists can create adaptive systems that improve performance through experience—similar to how humans learn.


Problem-Solving Approach

As a computer scientist, I approach problems methodically: first defining the problem and the success criteria, then designing a solution using theoretical knowledge (in this case, the Bellman equation and exploration–exploitation balance), and finally testing and iterating to improve results. Debugging and tuning hyperparameters became part of this scientific process, teaching me how to balance exploration and efficiency in learning systems.


Ethical Responsibilities

Ethics play a crucial role in every stage of software development. When designing intelligent systems, I must consider how the model impacts users, data privacy, and fairness. For example, if reinforcement learning is used in areas like autonomous vehicles or resource allocation, it’s my responsibility to ensure transparency, minimize harm, and maintain accountability for how the algorithm behaves. As a computer scientist, I must prioritize the safety, privacy, and well-being of both end users and organizations when developing AI-driven solutions.
